Many publishing companies rejected her book. Twelve different publishers said \\\"No\\\" to her story. Finally, one small company, Bloomsbury, agreed to publish it.

She was a single mother and often did not have much money. She wrote the first Harry Potter book in small cafes, sometimes using old, used napkins to write her ideas. Many publishing companies rejected her book. Twelve different publishers said \\\"No\\\" to her story. Finally, one small company, Bloomsbury, agreed to publish it. They only printed a very small number of copies at first. Rowling never stopped believing in her magical world and her writing. Today, the Harry Potter books have sold more than 500 million copies around the world. Her story shows that hard work and belief can turn a difficult life into a famous success.\",\n",
